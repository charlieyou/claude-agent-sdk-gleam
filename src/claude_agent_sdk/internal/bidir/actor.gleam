/// Actor stub for bidirectional sessions.
///
/// This module is a placeholder. The actual OTP actor implementation
/// remains in bidir.gleam until T003 (actor extraction).
///
/// ## Module Boundaries
///
/// - **bidir.gleam**: Full OTP actor with Process/Subject dependencies
/// - **actor.gleam** (this file): Empty stub for future extraction
///
/// The extraction will be done in T003 after pure modules are stable.
